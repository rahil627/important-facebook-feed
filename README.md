# important facebook feed
this may have been my first artistic tech project...ever?

heck, it might just be my *most important* project!... this was when Facebook was new, and i wanted a way to filter the feed for only important posts. In the end, i think i just gave up on using facebook, lol.

too bad i hated php, api, and web-programming in general!! This was wayyyy too painful to complete. :(
